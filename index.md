## Welcome

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, working in the MLD3 lab under [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/). I do Machine Learning for Healthcare, and am particularly interested in temporal prediction.

I received my Bachelors degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in Economics and Mathematics.
